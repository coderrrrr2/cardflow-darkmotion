# 🎞️ cardflow-darkmotion

A smooth, swipeable dark mode card animation built with Flutter — inspired by a sleek [Dribbble design](https://dribbble.com/shots/11109492-Darkmode-card-interactions-using-principleapp). This project brings that interaction to life using Flutter’s animation framework and gesture detection.
